# number2

Welcome to number2! This is the rails app of the tuesdays project
group.

With it you can manage places, enter their address and (soon) upload
images.

## Getting started

Fork the repository on github by pressing the "Fork" button on the top
right and follow instructions there. Then:

    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/number2.git
    cd number2
    bundle install
    rake db:migrate
    rails s

Go to http://localhost:3000/ - you should see the headline "Listing
places" and an empty list.
