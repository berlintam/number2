# number2

Welcome to number2! This is the rails app of the tuesdays project
group.

With it you can manage places, enter their address and (soon) upload
images.

## Getting started

    git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL
    cd number2
    bundle install
    rake db:migrate
    rails s

Go to http://localhost:3000/ - you should see the headline "Listing
places" and an empty list.
